IPA-Palette-with-Khmer
======================

Importing a custom-symbols plist into IPA Palette (on Mac OS X) enables users to create their own palette of Unicode characters. Entering Khmer via input palette is useful since few Mac users have a Khmer keyboard installed.

IPA Palette is a Unicode input method for the Mac created by Brian S. "Moses" Hall. It allows users of OS X 10.5 and later to insert International Phonetic Alphabet symbols in any Unicode-enabled text field or editor. IPA Palette home page is located at http://www.blugs.com/IPA. Documentation for installing and enabling the palette appears at http://www.blugs.com/IPA/doc; instructions on importing a custom symbols plist are on that page as well.
